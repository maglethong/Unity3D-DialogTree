# Unity3D-DialogTree [Placeholder repository]

Dialog tree system for Unity3D using a xml file structure to store dialogs.
The system has a small parser integrated that allows the interpretation and execution of simples instructions such as comparison, variable attribution and method calls.

Current status:
- Base dialog file structure
- Parser partially implemented (Method calls, attributions)

Working on:
- Finalizing the parser (comparison / conditional dialog branches)

Planed features:
- Visual editor
- Work on better efficiency
